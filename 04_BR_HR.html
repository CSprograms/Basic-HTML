        The HTML Paragraph element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are 
        usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from 
        adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation. But 
        HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, 
        such as images or form fields.
